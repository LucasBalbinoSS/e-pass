Landing page created for the E-pass company project.
The project is essentially about using NFC technology on mobile phones to unlock turnstiles in universities, enhancing security.

The landing page introduces the project and will soon allow users to install the app on both Android and iOS devices.

One of the key features of this landing page is accessibility. Users can increase or decrease the font size for better readability. Additionally, the site offers a feature that enables users to have each word read in sign language.
